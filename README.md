## Introduction

The project aims to transform the department's PLC training kit into a remote control lab using relay-based technology. By integrating relays, the lab's functionalities can be controlled remotely through a digital interface. This innovative approach enhances accessibility, allowing users to engage with the PLC training kit from any location. Through relay-based control, participants can remotely simulate real-world industrial scenarios, gaining valuable hands-on experience. This project emphasizes practical learning, providing students with a convenient and versatile platform to develop their skills in programmable logic controllers and automation systems.
