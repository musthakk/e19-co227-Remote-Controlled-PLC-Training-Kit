# Remote Controlled PLC Training Kit

## Project Overview
The Remote Controlled PLC Training Kit is a hands-on educational project that allows users to learn about Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and automation systems. In this project, we connect digital inputs of the PLC to relays, which are controlled using an Arduino. Additionally, analog inputs are interfaced directly with the Arduino. The user interface for this system is developed using Node-RED, providing a user-friendly and accessible way to interact with the training kit.

## Project Components
- PLC: The central control unit responsible for managing and controlling various processes remotely.
- Arduino: Used to control the relays and interface with analog inputs.
- Relays: Connected to digital inputs of the PLC for remote control.
- Analog Inputs: Interfaced directly with the Arduino for data acquisition.
- Node-RED: Provides the user interface for the training kit, eliminating the need for a separate app download.

## Features
