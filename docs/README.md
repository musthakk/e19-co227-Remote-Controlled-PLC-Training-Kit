# Remote Controlled PLC Training Kit

![PLC Training Kit](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e19-co227-Remote-Controlled-PLC-Training-Kit/blob/main/PLC-Training-Kit.jpg)

## Project Overview
The Remote Controlled PLC Training Kit is an educational project designed for users to learn about Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and automation systems. It features the integration of PLCs and Arduinos to control relays and allows direct interfacing of analog inputs. The user-friendly web-based interface is developed using Node-RED, eliminating the need for a separate app download.

## Project Components
- **PLC:** The central control unit responsible for remote process management.
- **Arduino:** Controls the relays and interfaces with analog inputs.
- **Relays:** Connected to digital inputs of the PLC for remote control.
- **Analog Inputs:** Directly interfaced with the Arduino for data acquisition.
- **Node-RED:** Provides a user-friendly web interface.

## Key Features
- User-friendly web-based interface developed with Node-RED.
- Remote control of relays via digital inputs of the PLC.
- Direct interfacing of analog inputs with the Arduino.
- No app download required; access the system with an internet connection.

## Getting Started
